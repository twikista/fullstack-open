# Part 3: Programming a server with Node JS and Express

> In this part, we focus on implementing the backend functionality of a phonebook app. Using Node Js and Express, we build a simple REST API that serves the frontend of our application with data which stored in a MongoDB database. Finally, we deploy the application to the internet using [render.com](https://render.com).
